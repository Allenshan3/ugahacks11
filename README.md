## Purpose of Project
```
Helping you find jobs and internships within the Georgia community that match your time, skills, and interests. Create and track your jobs and internships applications in one place.
Our team collaboratively designed, developed, and deployed this full-stack web application using React + Next.js, Node.js and MongoDB. Our application is a Athens/UGA Job, Internship or Opportunity Tracker. Users can search for jobs or paste a resume that will be parsed by a LLM (OpenAI Open-Source model hosted by Groq) that return ATS keywords relevant to the resume. Users can then click the keywords to query an API (Jsearch API from RapidAPI) with those keywords to find jobs relevant to their resume. Users can CREATE (add jobs returned by the API to the tracker), READ (read information about the jobs on the tracker), UPDATE (update job application information in the tracker), and DELETE (delete jobs from the tracker).
